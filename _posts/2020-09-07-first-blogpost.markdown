Hold before your eyes often the fact that you are going to die. Be it months from now or in decades, your death is inevitable. If you were to die this coming weekend, what would your last few days look like? Would you continue doing what you have already planned? 

Ask yourself often the question whether or not you are on the right track and if, should you die unexpectedly, it is while you are acting out your inclination.

If the answer is yes, if you do act in accordance with what your soul calls for, death is not that big of a threat anymore. This also makes sure that you do not live life in a wasteful manner and instead you do the work that you were placed in this existence for.
